Created a train schedule app from **Firebase** to host arrival and departure data

Provided up-to-date information about various trains (i.e. arrival time, minutes till departure)

Administrators can submit:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
  The app calculates arrival of the next train relative to the current time
